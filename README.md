# Valheim Dedicated Server Scripts
This repo contains scripts and service files that I use to run a set of private Valheim servers. A significant amount of my time and effort surrounds the support and use of Valheim Plus, the best quality-of-life mod I have seen for Valheim.

Some of this stuff will be unique to my setup, but over time I will rewrite scripts to be more system-agnostic.
I don't think I can account for the privilege constraints one might have via a hosting provider, so that will remain out of scope for my development efforts, at least for the time being. You're free to share what you can and cannot do on the issue tracker and I'll see what I can do to account for that, though.

Last but not least, I hope this helps and makes your life easier.
